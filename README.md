# Competition between action plans tracks with evidence accumulation rate during decision-making
The ability to change your mind when the local environment changes relies critically on cortico-basal ganglia-thalamic (CBGT) circuits. _In silico_ experiments on the CBGT pathways show how shifts in decision policy are driven by learning-induced changes in competition between action plans, both within and across action representations. We empirically validate this idea, using whole-brain hemodynamic imaging in _homo sapiens_ to show how competition between action representations in CBGT circuits adaptively shifts the rate of information accumulation in response to action-outcome contingency changes.
